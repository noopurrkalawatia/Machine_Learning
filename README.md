What is a machine learning pipeline?


•	This process of tying together different levels of the ML process is known as a pipeline. 

•	In machine learning, a pipeline is created to allow data flow from its raw format to some useful information.

•	The two important terms used are the transformers and the estimators. Transformers are the stages in the pipeline, that transform the data to the necessary format, which is then fed to the estimator.

•	Estimator is going to the machine learning model that estimates the necessary parameter of interest of the data.

•	It provides a mechanism to construct a multi-ML parallel pipeline system in order to compare the results of several ML
methods.
